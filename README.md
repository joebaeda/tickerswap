You can start editing file on the contracts folder [`contracts/YourToken.ts`](/contracts/YourToken.ts). Change the contract value with your own contract address.

```JS
export const yourToken = "0x4b18F45F5d019cF61cb9f001e8FEEa63cac22Ee0"; // Replace with your own token address
export const yourTokenChainId = 11155111; // Replace with the chainId (number) where your Token is deployed.
export const yourTokenChainHex = "0xaa36a7"; // Replace with the chainId (hex) where your Token is deployed.
export const chainCurrencySymbol = "ETH" // Replace with Currency Symbol of Network where your Token is deployed.
```
